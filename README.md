                                  ðŸª´Plant Monitoring and Automated Watering SystemðŸª´

This project is IoT based plant monitoring system which is  capable of automating the process by analyzing the moisture content of soil. Also, the data of sensors will be displayed on  the mobile phone using an application called blynk !
The main objective of this project is to design and implement an IoT (Internet of things) based smart plant monitoring system using NodeMCU (ESP8266), which is the open source for  IoT platform.
Our project includes both hardware and software. The hardware part includes the components for building the circuit and the software part  has Blynk application which is the digital dashboard where you can build a graphic interface for our project. And also uses arduino software for coding purpose.
