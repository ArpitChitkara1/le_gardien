# Project LE GARDIEN - ðŸª´Plant Monitoring and Automated Watering SystemðŸª´


## Description


This project is an IoT-based plant monitoring system capable of automating the watering process by analyzing the soil's moisture content. Sensor data is displayed on a mobile phone using the Blynk application. The main objective is to design and implement an IoT-based smart plant monitoring system using NodeMCU (ESP8266), an open-source IoT platform.

### Key Components

- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Soil Moisture Sensor Module
- DHT11 (Humidity and Temperature Sensor)
- 3-6V Mini Water Pump (Submersible)
- Relay Module
- Jumping Wires
- 9V Battery

This project includes both hardware and software. The hardware part involves building the circuit with the listed components. The software part utilizes the Blynk application for a digital dashboard and the Arduino IDE for coding.
